Dimemas testbed (Under development)
===============

Dimemas testbed for ensure the backward compatibility of new developments. It consists on a series of tests that check the good behaviour of all features. 

test.py script will compare the results generated by the prv2dim and dimemas
binaries passed by parameter with the results on the tests_folder.

The test_folder must contain the next directory tree
    |- test_folder/config Configurations to test
    |- test_folder/input  Paraver traces to test
    |- test_folder/dim    Dimemas traces after apply prv2dim
    |- test_folder/sim    Paraver traces after simulate
    |       | - <conf-name> Paraver traces after simulate with conf-name.cfg
    |       |   | - trace.sim.prv
    |       | - ....
    |- test_folder/err    This script will write errors on this folder


Current tests
=============

test-traces-non-block-colls
---------------------------
In this folder are all the tests related to collectives communication models. Blocking and non blocking collective communications will be tested.

test-traces-p2p-block-colls
---------------------------
In this folder are all the tests related to the point to point communication models. As at collectives, blocking and non blocking communications will be tested.

DIFFERENT PROCESS MAPPINGS
--------------------------
(*) For both tests above, different process mapping configurations will be tested. 

- Intra-node mapping: It will consist on just intra-node communications.
- Inter-node mapping: It will consists on intra-node and inter-node communications.
- Inter-machine mapping: It will consists on intra-node, inter-node and inter-machine communciations.
