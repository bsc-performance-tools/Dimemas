20160920 - Dimemas GPU extension: actually a kernel thread runs in a CPU unit as every thread. Only GPU params are
	   used to simulate the comms between a host thread an a kernel thread. When a node has mapped
	   more threads than CPUs, an accelerator thread probably will wait too much for a CPU when in a real
	   case there will be no waiting because the GPU will only run few threads. The solution is to mark a CPU unit
	   somehow to assign exclusively kernel threads there and not every type of thread.

20130130 - Dimemas/Venus interaction reported

20121211 - Show a warning / Generate fake COMM_WORLD communicator when no communicators are defined on the trace

20121205 - Merge 'trf2dim' with Vladimir's 'trf2trf' translators (to support StarSs/Tareador trace translation)

DONE 20121213 - Add a random component (PID?) to 'Paraver' temporal files to allow multiple simultaneous runs...

20121217 - Overflows when reading big event values

20121217 - Collectives model do not take into account the different mappings
