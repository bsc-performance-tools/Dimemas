Check 'configure --help' for specific compilation options.

   Most common configuration line is:

   * ./configure --enable-large-traces --with-time-limit=<simulation_limit_in_seconds>

   Other useful options are:

   * --enable-debug: to produce a more accurate description of the simulation

   * --enable-optimization: to compile the simulator with higher compiler
     optimization.

   Rest of the options usually regard to very specific simulation facts.Do not
