Structure

Date - user - Tool (Simulator | GUI | prv2dim | trf2dim | Other)

	FEATURES: 	explanation of new features

	BUGFIX:   	explanation of bug solved

	CHANGES:  	explanation of codification changes

2012/07/31 - jgonzale - Other
	CHANGES:	Small change in the building system to guarantee the
				big file flags inclusion.

2012/07/12 - jgonzale - GUI

	CHANGES:	GUI script is now called 'DimemasGUI'. It is installation
				agnostic, and performs better checks for user-environment
				variables and JRE installation.

2012/07/11 - jgonzale - Other

	CHANGES:	'configure.ac.' moved to 'configure.ac.template' to keep
				track of the versioning easily.

2012/07/11 - jgonzale - trf2dim

	BUGFIX:		Offsets generation adapted to new trace format.

2012/07/11 - jgonzale - Other

	CHANGES:	Full integration of the simulator, GUI and translators in
				a single package to ease the tool distribution and maintenance.

	CHANGES:	Commit tagged as Version 4 of the tool, considering stability
				of the stability of HOPSA integration.

2012/07/05 - jgonzale - GUI
	
	CHANGES:	Deep modification of 'DimemasGUI' to correctly generate new
				CFGs files (using new block codification). It is still
				under validation.

2012/03/27 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	FEATURES:	changed 'iprobe' translation to indicate the iprobe threshold
				in a miliseconds 'rate' instead of absolute values

2012/03/23 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	BUGFIX:		solved a wrong header creation when less file descriptors than
				tasks to translate were available.
				
	CHANGES:	better distinction of wrong communication primitives inside
				wrong block (FEATURE of 2012/03/22). 

2012/03/22 - grodrigu - Simulator
	
	BUGFIX:		Solved a bug on parsing: when reading NOOPs offset location
				was not updated properly.

2012/03/22 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	FEATURES:	SVN numbering using 'configure.ac.template' and a modification
				on 'autogen.sh' that uses 'svnversion' application.

	FEATURES:	Added a check when communication primitives inside a MPI
				block does not correspond to the expected (for example a send
				primitive inside MPI_recv). A warning message is thrown.

				That solves a miss-translation bug discovered in Dalton
				caused by the time granularity of the Paraver trace.

2012/03/05 - jgonzale - Simulator
	
	CHANGES:	MALLOC_free_memory does not need size any more. Erased
				alternative implementation of memory allocation (pool based).

2012/02/28 - jgonzale - Other

	CHANGES:	Minimun integration

2012/02/21 - grodrigu - Simulator

	FEATURES:	Added support for application reloading

	BUGFIX:		Solved a bug when using 'off_t', 'size_t' and 'int' to
				index structures.

	BUGFIX:		Corrected spelling mistake in 'configure.ac'

	BUGFIX:		Solved a pattern matching when reading MPI communaction
				primitives and some pointer errors in 'file_data_access.c'

2012/02/03 - jgonzale - Simulator

	CHANGES:	Complete integration of all Dimemas versions. 

	CHANGES:	Total change of 'file_data_acces.c'. Now is uses 'getline'
				and 'sscanf' as basic ASCII parsing of DIM traces. It also
				performs a more sofisticated file descriptor sharing in
				conjunction with the new IO library (under the 'io' directory).
				Some primitives defined in the new trace description are not
				supported yet (One-Sided definitions and operations).

				The new IO library acts as a wrapper between the actual C
				'stdio.h' and the Dimemas code. The main feature is the
				ability to account the number of available file descriptors.
				This accounting is crucial for optimal file descriptor sharing.

	CHANGES:	Also present in the 2012/01/11 commit, but more extended, is
				the clear separation of simulator loading and the model
				itself. It is not perfect, but the files 'configuration.c|h'
				and 'comm_configuration.c|h') include the vast majority of
				'target machine' initialization. The schedulers initiliazation
				has not been moved to this location, due to its 'function
				pointers' design.

	CHANGES:	Paraver trace generation has been completely redesign. Now
				it produces a set of sorted temporal files for states and
				communications and a single sorted file for events. The final
				merge is an external merge sort (found via Wikipedia in:
				http://cis.stvincent.edu/html/tutorials/swd/extsort/extsort.html)
				with a fan in of 2. In this way, the required open files
				is reduced just to 3 (States&Comms. File, Events File, Output
				PRV tracefile). The memory usage is up to 3 times the size
				of the MAX_IN_FLIGHT_RECORDS (unfortunately, not in bytes),
				located in 'external_sort.h'. When producing the temporal 
				files it just used 1 buffer of this size. When merging it uses
				3 buffers. The number of states and comms. temporal files is
				also related to this value (by default: 10000).

				PCF file is copied from the first trace that appears in the
				configuration file. If not available, default PCF is generated.

	CHANGES:	Now the Dimemas core is *always in nanoseconds*. This is not
				a dramatic change in terms of configuration files, input
				traces, etc. (due they expressed in seconds). The output
				files are afected because the granularity of the timestamps
				is bigger (9 significant digits).

	CHANGES:	There are some (possible) regressions pending to be checked:

				- Application reloads
				- Performance messages (they work but need to manually add
				  'rt' library)
				- Multi-machine environment and multi-application environment
				(no traces available)
				- New modules management version on DimemasGUI not updated
	
	FEATURES: 	Added a simple binary called 'DimemasUpdateCFG' to CFGs with old 
				modules definition to new version.

2012/02/03 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	CHANGES:	Traces are generated *always* in nanoseconds granularity.

	FEATURES:	PCF file is copied from input trace. If it does not exists
				a default is generated.
	
	FEATURES:	Added CodeBlocks project

2012/01/11 - jgonzale

	CHANGES:	First commit with the merge of the Vladimir+German+Official
				versions. Now, the TRF trace is deprecated, and all improvements
				should be written on the DIM trace. In further commits, all
				code that manages the SDDF trace will be erased progresively
				adopting the DIM (Paraver style trace) codification of 
				equivalent semantics.

				There have been modifications by Vladimir in the original DIM
				trace, basically adding offsets for all threads of all tasks,
				sorting each task per thread and adding the thread field on
				the P2P communication primitives. This has to be documented.

				The current version supports the codification of CPU ratios
				using user events present on DIM trace. Paraver and Dimemas
				will use same event encoding, and Dimemas blocks are discontinued.

				Now it lacks support of generating PCF file, but it can be
				copied using the '-pc' parameter.

				Most part of the File IO simulation is not currently supported.
				It should be analyzed and ported.

	FEATURES:	It has been added the skeleton to implement the new scalable
				IO, as part of the HOPSA project. Every IO made by Dimemas
				should use the new interface to be implemented.

2012/01/05 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	CHANGES:	Major changes to generate the new DIM format accepted by
				the Dimemas merged from Vladimir (StarSs)/Official(MPI)
				versions
			
				Major changes in the trace file result from the P2P 
				communication primitives, which include the origin/destination
				thread. In MPI, this field takes the value '-1', but should
				be changed to keep the trace elegant.

				As a comment, it manipulates the MPI/Cluster/User blocks 
				in the old fashion, but generates user events using the
				Paraver encoding. We should evaluate dropping support
				to TRF files translation.

2011/10/24 - jgonzale - prv2dim

	CHANGES: 	Building system now builds both translators at the
				same time

	FEATURES:	Added support to translate 'User Functions' in the same
				way the Clusters are translated.

2011/07/14 - jgonzale - Other

	CHANGES:	MAJOR modifications in building system. Now, each big module

2010/07/07 - jgonzale - Simulator

	BUGFIX:		Solved a *big* issue regarding to the use of communicators
				when simulating collective operations. The 'global OP' records
				generated by 'prv2dim' didn't express the actual root of an
				collective operation, just which thread is the root. Right
				now, this is taken into account in the simulation engine.
