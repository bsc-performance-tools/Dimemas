2012/02/03 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Complete integration of all Dimemas versions. 

	CHANGES:	Total change of 'file_data_acces.c'. Now is uses 'getline'
				and 'sscanf' as basic ASCII parsing of DIM traces. It also
				performs a more sofisticated file descriptor sharing in
				conjunction with the new IO library (under the 'io' directory).
				Some primitives defined in the new trace description are not
				supported yet (One-Sided definitions and operations).

				The new IO library acts as a wrapper between the actual C
				'stdio.h' and the Dimemas code. The main feature is the
				ability to account the number of available file descriptors.
				This accounting is crucial for optimal file descriptor sharing.

	CHANGES:	Also present in the 2012/01/11 commit, but more extended, is
				the clear separation of simulator loading and the model
				itself. It is not perfect, but the files 'configuration.c|h'
				and 'comm_configuration.c|h') include the vast majority of
				'target machine' initialization. The schedulers initiliazation
				has not been moved to this location, due to its 'function
				pointers' design.

	CHANGES:	Paraver trace generation has been completely redesign. Now
				it produces a set of sorted temporal files for states and
				communications and a single sorted file for events. The final
				merge is an external merge sort (found via Wikipedia in:
				http://cis.stvincent.edu/html/tutorials/swd/extsort/extsort.html)
				with a fan in of 2. In this way, the required open files
				is reduced just to 3 (States&Comms. File, Events File, Output
				PRV tracefile). The memory usage is up to 3 times the size
				of the MAX_IN_FLIGHT_RECORDS (unfortunately, not in bytes),
				located in 'external_sort.h'. When producing the temporal 
				files it just used 1 buffer of this size. When merging it uses
				3 buffers. The number of states and comms. temporal files is
				also related to this value (by default: 10000).

				PCF file is copied from the first trace that appears in the
				configuration file. If not available, default PCF is generated.

	CHANGES:	Now the Dimemas core is *always in nanoseconds*. This is not
				a dramatic change in terms of configuration files, input
				traces, etc. (due they expressed in seconds). The output
				files are afected because the granularity of the timestamps
				is bigger (9 significant digits).

	CHANGES:	There are some (possible) regressions pending to be checked:

				- Application reloads
				- Performance messages (they work but need to manually add
				  'rt' library)
				- Multi-machine environment and multi-application environment
				(no traces available)
				- New modules management version on DimemasGUI not updated
	
	FEATURES: 	Added a simple binary called 'DimemasUpdateCFG' to CFGs with old 
				modules definition to new version.

2012/01/11 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	First commit with the merge of the Vladimir+German+Official
				versions. Now, the TRF trace is deprecated, and all improvements
				should be written on the DIM trace. In further commits, all
				code that manages the SDDF trace will be erased progresively
				adopting the DIM (Paraver style trace) codification of 
				equivalent semantics.

				There have been modifications by Vladimir in the original DIM
				trace, basically adding offsets for all threads of all tasks,
				sorting each task per thread and adding the thread field on
				the P2P communication primitives. This has to be documented.

				The current version supports the codification of CPU ratios
				using user events present on DIM trace. Paraver and Dimemas
				will use same event encoding, and Dimemas blocks are discontinued.

				Now it lacks support of generating PCF file, but it can be
				copied using the '-pc' parameter.

				Most part of the File IO simulation is not currently supported.
				It should be analyzed and ported.

	FEATURES:	It has been added the skeleton to implement the new scalable
				IO, as part of the HOPSA project. Every IO made by Dimemas
				should use the new interface to be implemented.

2011/07/14 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	MAJOR modifications in building system. Now, each big module
				of core code is compiled as a facility library. That was
				modified in previous update, but not added up to this one

2011/07/13 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Minor cosmetic changes in building system

2010/07/13 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		Solved an error in the PCF generation, caused by the macro
				change. It generated 'null' event value names

2010/07/07 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		Solved a *big* issue regarding to the use of communicators
				when simulating collective operations. The 'global OP' records
				generated by 'prv2trf' didn't express the actual root of an
				collective operation, just which thread is the root. Right
				now, this is taken into account in the simulation engine.

2010/05/11 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Cluster blocks are now translated coherently when generating
				Paraver trace

2010/05/04 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Increase value of 'BUFSIZE' and 'YYMAXDEPTH' to improve
				scalability. Should be revised

2010/03/19 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:    Only 'javac' is checked when looking for Java compilers
	BUGFIX:		Solved used of 'getenv' into the Dimemas GUI

2010/03/15 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		GUI is only compiled if Java Compiler is present. Previously it
				tried to compile it always.
	CHANGES:	Java m4 macros don't stop when no available compiler/VM/jar is
				found
	CHANGES:	Configure script no longer offers debug/optimization flags.
				User must provide this information using CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.
	CHANGES:	Removed 'aclocal.m4' from the package distribution.

2010/03/10 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Minor changes on GUI

2010/03/09 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Completed changes to integrate the Java GUI into the main
				Dimemas packaging. See DimemasGUI directory
	CHANGES:	Added 'm4' directories to add automake macros

2010/03/03 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		Solved a small misuse when generating the distribution
				package
	CHANGES:	Minor cosmetic changes in 'README' file and elimination of
				very old configuration options

2010/02/15 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Cleaning to liberate Dimemas code

2009/10/14 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		Solved a bug in 'transferencia' function, which did not
				return the total transfer time correctly. Right now, resources
				time and transfer time are return using output parameters

2007/11/28 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	The output binary is now called Dimemas3
	CHANGES:	Modifications in data access layer to use traces numbered in
				range 0..N-1
	BUGFIX:		Correct read in data access layer for 'rendez_vous' attribute

2007/11/05 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:    Added 'enable-idle-accounting' compilation option to not
				include the idle blocks on CPU consumption accounting

2007/10/29 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Incresed API buffer size, in order to correct simulate traces
				with big headers

2007/09/21 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		In function 'thread_in_communicator', TaskId of thread is
				not modified

2007/06/13 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		In function 'DAP_add_comm' from data access API the queues of
				new communicators are initialized
	BUGFIX:     'add_global_ops' function in 'read.c' file is moved to correct
				xlc compilation

2007/05/07 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	Time adjust (apply 1e6 factor) is done in 'get_next_action' on
				read.c, instead of on the data access API.

2007/04/20 - jgonzale
	CHANGES:	MAJOR CHANGE. New data access API is used.

2007/03/15 - jgonzale
	BUGFIX:		Solved a problem related to Paraver trace generation where
				IDLE_BLOCKs where incorrectly translated
	CHANGES:	Major changes in Paraver trace generation. Some files has been
				moved to 'common-files'. Now state color generation is coherent
				with burst-clusterizer and the trace facility.
